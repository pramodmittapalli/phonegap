composite-look synthetic is bonded to an impact-resistant polycarbonate &#xD;
shell that fits snugly around your iPhone. The Griffin EasyDock design means you &#xD;

&lt;p&gt;Extend your surfing, talking, and tune time on your iPhone with the PowerJolt &#xD;
Reserve. At the same time you’re charging your iPhone’s internal battery, you're also charging the detachable reserve battery pack. It's like getting twice as much use out of every charge. You can also plug PowerJolt into your cigarette lighter or 12 volt power outlet to charge your iPhone in the car while you use it. When you arrive at your destination, unclip the Reserve battery pack and take it with you. PowerJolt works with iPhone,&#xD;
 iPod, and almost any other device that charges by a standard USB connection. No more worrying about battery life!&lt;/p&gt;</AccessoryLongDescription>

The Nintendo DSi also features built-in internet capabilities, meaning the fun begins the moment you switch it on!  If you’re scared of running out of space, you can expand the memory with a microSD card.

&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Designed to work seamlessly with your O2 wireless box or O2 wireless box II, the O2 broadband wireless adapter allows your laptop or computer to use the O2 Broadband service without the need of wires. Using Wi-Fi, also known as wireless LAN or WLAN, it allows you to access the Internet or data such as music, video or files on other equipment within your own network. Working wirelessly offers flexibility and with the inbuilt security you can be safe too(*).&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/div&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&lt;div&gt;&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Technical specification:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;

&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WLAN :-&lt;/strong&gt;                             802.11b/g compliant and includes Wi-Fi Multimedia quality of service&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interface:- &lt;/strong&gt;                         USB2.0 interface, backwards compatible to the USB1.1 and 1.0 specifications.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/div&gt; &#xD;
&lt;div&gt;&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;For effective working:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ol&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;As with all new hardware or software installations, we recommend backing up your sensitive data in advance.&lt;/li&gt; &#xD;
&lt;li&gt;This device requires specific device drivers to be installed on your laptop or computer, these drivers are provided to you by O2.&lt;/li&gt; &#xD;
&lt;li&gt;The security mode, security keys, passphrases, etc must match between your O2 broadband wireless adapter and your O2 wireless box. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;This device is not compatible with the O2 mobile network, it is for short range communications to your O2 wireless box only. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;li&gt;Only for laptops or computers which do not already have an in-built wi-fi or wireless adapter.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/ol&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/div&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(*) Please note you will need to select a security level that is appropriate to you and your other equipment. The O2 wireless box is shipped with the basic level which is WEP (64-bit), the best for interoperability. For added security you may want to consider WPA or WPA2 if your other devices support it. Please consult your terms and conditions for more information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
